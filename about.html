        <h2>Types of Crustaceans</h2>
        <p>There many different types of crustaceans! Here are some below:</p>
        <div class="row">

                <img class="TableImg" src="Images/Crab.png">
                <h3 class="CrustData"><strong>Crab</strong></h3>
                <p class="CrustData">Crabs are epic! Crabs are known for having big meaty claws and have tough shells.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-4 dataSection">
                <img class="TableImg" src="Images/Lobster.png">
                <h3 class="CrustData"><strong>Lobster</strong></h3>
                <p class="CrustData">Lobsters are epic! Lobsters are very similar to crabs, but have a different body structure. They are more narrow, as well as more mobile as they have a fan tail.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-4 dataSection">
                <img class="TableImg" src="Images/Crayfish.png">
                <h3 class="CrustData"><strong>Crayfish</strong></h3>
                <p class="CrustData">Crayfish are epic! Incredibly similar to lobsters, but live in freshwater environments. These guys are more adapted to these environments and end up being a lot smaller than lobsters on average.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-4 dataSection">
                <img class="TableImg" src="Images/Shrimp.png">
                <h3 class="CrustData"><strong>Shrimp</strong></h3>
                <p class="CrustData">Shrimp are epic! They are very small crustaceans, but are very complex! With over 13 pairs of appendages, they are able to get a lot done!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-4 dataSection">
                <img class="TableImg" src="Images/Pillbug.png">
                <h3 class="CrustData"><strong>Pillbugs</strong></h3>
                <p class="CrustData">Pill bugs are epic! These guys are very different from the rest as they are fully terestrial! While they may seem like insects, they are actually crustaceans! Insects are a distant relative to crustaceans, but crustaceans came first!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-4 dataSection">
                <img class="TableImg" src="Images/Barnacles.png">
                <h3 class="CrustData"><strong>Barnacles</strong></h3>
                <p class="CrustData">Barnacles are epic! Another weird entry, as they are so unlike crustaceans that they don't even move! Barnacles are sessile filter feeders, meaing they sit around and suck in micro organisms like a vaccum!</p>
